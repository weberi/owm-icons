Weather Icons Lite is a collection of weather themed icons, **which are already integrated within node-RED**, or can be used in any project that needs high quality weather & moon phase icons!

This repository provides images of these icons renamed to match OpenWeatherMap Icon Codes, making them easy to access and use directly with OpenWeatherMapâ€™s API responses.

For example, you can use the following URL:

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weberi/weather-icons-lite/refs/heads/master/images/**01d**.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weberi/weather-icons-lite/refs/heads/master/images/01d.jpg)

instead of:

[https://openweathermap.org/img/wn/**01d**@2x.png](https://openweathermap.org/img/wn/01d@2x.png)
